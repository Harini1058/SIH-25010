## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution

To enhance agricultural yield, we propose a smart, data-driven platform that leverages IoT sensors, satellite imagery, and machine learning to provide real-time, location-specific recommendations to farmers. This platform will monitor soil health, moisture levels, crop growth stages, and weather forecasts to suggest optimal sowing times, irrigation schedules, and fertilizer usage. Additionally, the system will integrate historical yield data and crop patterns to predict the best crops for a particular region. Through a mobile application in regional languages, farmers can receive alerts, recommendations, and connect with experts. This solution not only increases productivity but also promotes sustainable farming practices by minimizing resource wastage and reducing dependency on guesswork.

## Technical Approach

<h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
<h3>IoT Sensors:</h3> Deploy soil moisture sensors, pH sensors, and temperature sensors in the field.
<h3>Satellite and Drone Imaging:</h3>Use remote sensing to gather NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and crop health data.
<h3>Weather APIs</h3> Integrate real-time and forecasted weather data through APIs like OpenWeatherMap or IMD.


<h3>2. Data Storage and Processing</h3>
<h3>Cloud Storage:</h3> Use platforms like AWS, Azure, or Firebase to store sensor and user data securely.
<h3>Edge Computing:</h3> Preprocess sensor data on local devices (Raspberry Pi, Arduino) to reduce transmission load.


<h3>3. Machine Learning Models</h3>
<h3>Yield Prediction Model:</h3> Train regression models using historical yield, weather, soil, and crop data.
<h3>Recommendation System:</h3> Develop ML algorithms to suggest crop types, irrigation schedules, and fertilizers.
<h3>Pest/Disease Detection:</h3> Use image classification models (CNNs) for early pest or disease identification from leaf images.


<h3>4. Mobile/Web Interface</h3>
<h3>Farmer App (Android/iOS):</h3> UI in regional languages for ease of access.
<h3>Features:</h3>Weather alerts, crop recommendations, real-time analytics, expert chat support.
<h3>Admin Dashboard:</h3>For researchers/agronomists to track trends and update recommendations.


<h3>5. Integration</h3>
<h3>Government/Agri Databases:</h3> Pull soil maps and subsidy data from public databases.
<h3>E-Market Linkage:</h3> Integrate with e-NAM or local mandi APIs to suggest best selling locations and times.


<h3>6. Security & Scalability</h3>
<h3>User Authentication:</h3> Secure login and OTP verification for farmers.
<h3>Scalable Backend:</h3> Microservices architecture using Node.js/Python Flask for modular development.

This approach ensures accurate, real-time decisions to optimize farming practices, leading to better yield and sustainable agriculture.

## Feasibility and Viability

The proposed solution is both technically and economically feasible. From a technical standpoint, the integration of IoT devices, weather APIs, and machine learning models is achievable using readily available, low-cost hardware (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi) and open-source software tools. Many successful prototypes have already demonstrated the effectiveness of sensor-based farming and data-driven crop management. In terms of viability, the solution is scalable to small and large farms, and can be customized based on regional agricultural needs. The mobile app and dashboard can be localized in regional languages, making it accessible to farmers with minimal digital literacy. Moreover, cloud services ensure that the system can handle large data volumes from multiple users. Economically, the project can start on a small scale and expand with support from government schemes like PM-KISAN and Digital India initiatives, making it sustainable in the long term and impactful in increasing agricultural yield

## Impact and Benefits

The proposed solution has the potential to significantly enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability. By providing farmers with real-time data on soil moisture, weather conditions, and crop health, it empowers them to make informed decisions regarding irrigation, fertilization, and pest control. This leads to optimized resource usage, reduced crop losses, and improved yield quality and quantity. Additionally, the system can alert farmers about extreme weather conditions or disease outbreaks in advance, preventing potential damage. Economically, increased yield translates to higher income for farmers, contributing to poverty reduction and rural development. Socially, the solution promotes the adoption of smart farming practices and digital literacy. Environmentally, it encourages sustainable farming by minimizing water and chemical usage. Overall, this innovation supports the goals of precision agriculture and strengthens food security in the country.
